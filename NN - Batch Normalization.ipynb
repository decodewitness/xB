    "# Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batch normalization is a technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This has the effect of stabilizing the learning process and dramatically reduces the number of training epochs required to train deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Non) normalized features.\n",
    "    * non-normalized has a lot of zig-zags.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* With gradient descent the loss curve is more a straight line\n",
    "    * Optimal loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use Batch normalization for every layer.\n",
    "    * Adds mean-and-standard deviation (2 parameters) to each layer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* These parameters are calculated while training and are used to normalize in realtime predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Advantages of Batch normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Faster Training (less zig-zags).\n",
    "* Better accuracy.\n"
