    "# NLP - TFDIF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* TF-IDF is short for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is designed to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The value is calculated by multiplying two metrics:    \n",
    "    * How many times a word appears in a document.\n",
    "    * Inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "    * How common a word is in the entire document set.\n",
    "        * log(total no. of documents / no. of documents containing the word)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * The higher the score is, the more relevant the word is in that particular document.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Why TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information retrieval\n",
    "    * TF-IDF was invented for document search and is used to deliver results that are most relevant to what we are searching for.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Keyword extraction\n",
    "    * TF-IDF is also useful for keyword extraction. The highest scoring words for a document are the most relevant keywords."
