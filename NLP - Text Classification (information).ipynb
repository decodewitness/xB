    "# NLP - TEXT CLASSIFICATION\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classification or Text categorization is the process of analyzing the natural language text and labelling the text with a predefined set of labels or tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classifiers have proven to be a great alternative to structure textual data in a fast, cost-effective and scalable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It allows to easily get insights from data and automate business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis: Understanding if the text has positive, negative or neutral sentiment.\n",
    "* Language detection: Detecting the language of a given text.\n",
    "* Classifying content into categories to easily search and navigate within a website or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a very powerful tool for extracting value from unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use supervised learning algorithms for classifying text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of applications for Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tagging content or products using categories as a way to improve browsing or to identify related content on the website.\n",
    "    * E-commerce, news agencies, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As marketing is becoming more targeted every day, automated classification of users into cohorts can make a marketer's life simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classification of content on websites help Google crawl websites easily which helps with SEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email providers use text classification to differentiate between legitimate and spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text Classification using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning helps in text classification and classify based on past observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By using pre-labelled examples as training data, ML algorithms learn different associations between pieces of text, and that a particular output is expected for a particular input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning algorithms work only with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transform each piece of text into a numerical representation in the form of a vector.\n",

    "# Naive Bayes Classifier and Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is based on Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probability of an event occurring based on the occurrence of the previous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have a bag of 5 balls (2 red, 3 blue)\n",
    "* We're asked to randomly take out a ball.\n",
    "* What is the probability for red (2/5)\n",
    "* What is the probability for blue (3/5)\n",
    "* After taking out a red and blue ball it is (2/4) for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of 1 event depending on the probability of the previous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B) => P(A and B) = P(A/B) P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of event A, given B == A and B, divided by probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probability B, A===B and A, divided by probability of event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistics algorithm which uses Bayes theorem to predict the tag of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a probabilistic algorithm which means it calculates the probability of each tag for a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 4 major words in the categories Sport and not sport.\n",
    "    * 4 major words are, match, game, win and election\n",
    "    \n",
    "Sport                    Not sport\n",

    "Win      3  (3/15)       Win      5  (5/15)\n",
    "Election 1  (1/15)       Election 7  (7/15)\n",
    "\n",

    "* the probability of a new message in \"sport\" or \"not sport\" category is 50%.\n",

    "* P(sport/win election) = 0.006\n",
    "* P(not sport/win election) = 0.07\n",

    "# Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM is a powerful text classification machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "* SVM divides and separates the two sides by a line.\n",
    "* An optimal line is the one with the largest distance between each label.\n",
    "* It works both for linear as non-linear data.\n",

    "# More things to try\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can try some more classification models such as logistic regression and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of using TF-IDF vectorizer, we can use Bag of words to change the texts into numbers and check how the model accuracy changes.\n",
    "    - In case of Bag of words we can choose between Binary bag of words, or Frequency bag of words.\n",
