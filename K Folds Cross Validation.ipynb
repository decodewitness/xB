    "### Idea behind K Folds\n",
    "\n",
    "We fold our data int k number of folds where k generally is between 5 and 10.\n",
    "We save one fold for testing and k-n folds for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we iterate for the second time we use fold 2 for testing and the rest for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We re-create Train and Test split in every iteration and train our model from scratch.\n",
    "    a. If k=5, we need to train the model 5 times.\n",
    "    b. Computationally expensive when data is too large, or if our k-value is high."
