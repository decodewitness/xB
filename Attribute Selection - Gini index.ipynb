    "# Attribute Selection method w/ Gini\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In decision tree terminology \"Feature\" or a \"Column\" is called an 'Attribute'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are mainly two algorithms to control the splitting conditions in a decision tree.\n",
    "    a. Information gain (Entropy).\n",
    "    b. Gini index.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Root node -> subsets (homogenous / dissimilar)\n",
    "The entropy measures the homogenity of the samples are.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Similar samples in a Subset - Homogenous.\n",
    "2. If all samples in a subset are of the same type (Target), then the entropy of that split is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "E(S) = sum(c,i=1) - P(i) log(2) P(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the entropy keeps decreasing, then we keep increasing our confidence over a predictive class.\n",
    "    a. Split in the direction where the entropy decreases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The difference in the entropy before and after the split is called 'Information gain'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "a. 9-'yes', 5-'no'\n",
    "b. Entropy = -p(y)log(p(y))-p(n)log(p(n))\n",
    "c. p(y) = 9/14, p(n) = 5/14\n",
    "d. After solving, Entropy = 0.942.\n",
    "\n",
    "We split different attributes in columns based on the target values and calculate the entropy of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "E(T, X) = sum(c,e) * P(c)E(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy of column X with target column T is sum of that class multiplied by the entropy of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If sunny play (3 yes) (2 no)\n",
    "E(sunny) = -3/5 log 3/5 - 2/5 log 2/5 = 0.971\n",

    "\n",
    "Rainy (2 yes) (3 no)\n",
    "Entropy(rainy) = -2/5 log 2/5 -3/5 log 2/5 = 0.971\n",

    "A measure of impurity.\n",
