    "\n",
    "1. Weights are directly associated with features, the ability of interpreting the results is very high.\n",
    "    a. we can easily find out the relationship between the features and the predictive outcome which can add confidence to your decision making.\n",

    "2. You want to identify characteristics of people who are likely to not repay the loan.\n",
    "    a. You have data of 850 customers. The first 700 are customers who have already received loans.\n",
    "    b. You can train your model on those 700 data points and predict the risk of loan on the remaining 150.\n",

    "### Real Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "* First Horizon Bank boosted their profitability using \"IBM Machine learning\" and achieved increases of up to 600 percent in their campaigns.\n",

    "* Leaders at this bank wanted to approach the right customers with the right products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no shortage of data, but the challenge was to bridge the gap between having data and taking action.\n",
