    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a subfield of linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of NLP, we can communicate with computers using a natural language such as English.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Today NLP is booming with the advancements in the access to data and increase in the computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is helping practitioners to achieve meaningful results in areas like:\n",
    "    * Healthcare.\n",
    "    * Media.\n",
    "    * Finance.\n",
    "    * Etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problems with Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Today, millions of data is generated through conversations, declarations or tweets and this data is unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unstructured data does not fit into row and column structure which makes it difficult to analyze and manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why learn NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "* With the help of NLP, it is possible for the machines to detect figure of speech, like irony and even perform a sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can not have data in numbers all the time, so to deal with textual data we use NLP which can easily take raw language as input and derive meaningful insights from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Companies analyze structured data to analyze patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "* NLP enables the recognition and prediction of diseases based on electronic health records and a patient's own speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organizations can determine what customers are saying about a service or product by identifying and extracting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This sentiment analysis can tell a lot about customer's choices and their decision drivers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Big companies like Google filter and classify emails with NLP by analyzing text in emails and stopping spam emails before they enter your inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are examples of intelligent voice-driven interfaces that use NLP to respond to vocal prompts and do everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NLP is used in both search and selection phase of talent recruitment by identifying the skills of potential hires.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NLP is also used in search Autocorrect and Autocomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps to solve NLP problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gather Data\n",
    "    * Gather textual data from emails, post or tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean Data\n",
    "    * A clean dataset allows the model to learn meaningful features and not overfit on irrelevant noise.\n",
    "        * Remove all irrelevant characters.\n",
    "        * Tokenize the words by separating it in different words.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Convert all characters to lowercase. Combine misspelled or alternatively spelled words to single representation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Reduce words such as \"am\", \"are\", and \"is\" to a common form.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Finding good representation\n",
    "    \n",
    "        * Change textual data into numbers form which algorithms can understand and derive insight from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification\n",
    "    * Split the data into training and testing data.\n",
    "    * Classify the data using a model by fitting the training data into it and check how well the model generalizes on (an) unseen dataset using the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inspection\n",
    "    * Understand the errors made by the model using the confusion matrix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Visualize the confusion matrix and compare the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text Processing means analysis, manipulation and generation of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is the automated process which analyzes data for getting structured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It includes extracting smaller bits of information from text data and assigning tags depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Techniques to analyze text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We use statistical methods such as frequency distribution and TF-IDF to process and analyze text.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Text Classification classifies text into predefined groups based on its content. Popular models include: Topic Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Intent Detection, and Language Classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Text Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Text extraction is a text processing technique that identifies and obtains valuable pieces of data that are present within the text.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * This method helps us to detect and extract the relevant words or expressions from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "# Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stopwords are the words which do not add much value to a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are removed from the vocabulary to reduce noise as well as the dimensions of the feature set.\n",
