    "# NN - Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need for Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Even after using a proper architecture and methods to train the model, we do not get satisfactory results. This is a case where the problem lies in the data used to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Having a large dataset is crucial for the performance of the deep learning model. However, it can lack the quantity and diversity of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "You're trying to create a cat detector and have a hundred images, then you can apply some techniques to generate more data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cropping, Padding and Horizontal Flipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flip - horizontal/vertical flip.\n",
    "* Rotation - 90, 180, 270 degrees. (images between 30 and -30 degrees)\n",
    "* Random Cropping 256px -> 227px\n",
    "* Scaling - Zooming into image (20% or 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blurring Contrast Smoothing Sharpening and more.\n"
