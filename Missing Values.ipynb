    "# Missing Values -&- Imputing Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "##### types of missing values\n",
    "1. MCAR - Missing Completely At Random (missing)\n",
    "2. MAR  - Missing At Random (can be related to any other value in the dataset)\n",
    "3. MNAR - Missing Not At Random (missing with a reason)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### rules for columns\n",
    "* Delete the columns/rows with a very high percentage of missing data.\n",
    "* If the dataset is large, and the column has around 30~40% or more than that of missing data, delete it.\n",
    "* If the column has more than 20% or more missing data ;; delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### rules for rows\n",
    "* The same rules apply for rows.\n",
    "* If the row has more than 50 columns, delete the row.\n",
    "* If the row has more than 10 values missing, hence we can conclude that if any row has more than 20% of the values missing, then we can remove them from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### varying rules\n",
    "* These rules vary in different scenarios\n",
    "* If the column has high correlation with the target column, the removal of the row or column can lead to information loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Logic\n",
    "* We can use business logic and -1 or -999 to preserve the 0's when you want to impute the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### using Mode()\n",
    "1. median function\n",
    "2. mean function     # this one is very sensitive towards outliers"
